      		<span style="font-size:22px;">Plus size girls - a survival guide</span></p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<div style="text-align: justify;">
			<span style="font-size:16px;">We&#39;re fairly familiar with the fact that designers mostly create clothes for overly skinny girls, but the good news is that the fashion industry is starting to take plus size fashion more seriously.</span></div>
		<div style="text-align: justify;">
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div style="text-align: justify;">
			<span style="font-size:16px;">If you also have problems finding the right clothing size or model, you probably already know that shopping, a women&#39;s greatest pleasure, can turn into a very bad day. This is where everyone thinks that dieting is the solution, but the trick is to know exactly what kind of clothes to wear in order to look good.</span></div>
		<div style="text-align: justify;">
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div style="text-align: justify;">
			<span style="font-size:16px;">1. Get familiar with your body&#39;s measurements, that&#39;s how you&#39;ll be absolutely sure that your clothes fit comfortably. One of the biggest shopping mistakes a woman can do, is wearing clothes that are actually too big for her body. The fact that you have more pounds and curves than the mannequin in the shopping window, does not mean that you should try to hide your body under huge clothes that actually make it look like a sack. Choose pieces of clothing that go well with your figure and even more importantly, &nbsp;choose clothes that feel nice.</span></div>
		<div style="text-align: justify;">
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div style="text-align: justify;">
			<span style="font-size:16px;">2. Defining your style and body shape plays a very important part in choosing clothes for your body. Whether it&#39;s an outfit for work, a date outfit, or an outfit for a formal occasion, it will all be a lot easier and will take much less time, for you won&#39;t be trying on an outfit in which you don&#39;t even feel like yourself.</span></div>
		<div style="text-align: justify;">
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div style="text-align: justify;">
			<span style="font-size:16px;">3. Avoid clothes that don&#39;t emphasize your figure properly. Other than the baggy clothes that I mentioned above, &quot;formless&quot; clothes can also hide your body in a way that won&#39;t be to your advantage. A long dress with creases under the breasts will do a fine job hiding your stomach, for an instance. Pay good attention to the tailoring, it really might save you from visual plus pounds.</span></div>
		<div style="text-align: justify;">
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div style="text-align: justify;">
			<span style="font-size:16px;">4. About the black colour making you look slimmer, think outside of the box. For a decent look, the tailoring is way more relevant, as are the proportions and the style generated by all factors. Monochromatic palettes can look way more impressive than the outdated black. That doesn&#39;t mean you should throw out your black dress, but wearing different colours, especially around your head and shoulders, will effectively shift the attention towards your skin tone, your face shape, your eye color etc.</span></div>
		<div style="text-align: justify;">
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div style="text-align: justify;">
			<span style="font-size:16px;">5. At all costs avoid clothes with extra large prints all over the fabric. An outfit entirely composed of huge prints and patterns will look way too exaggerated and kitschy. A person&#39;s height is also a factor: the shorter the body, the smaller the prints should be.</span></div>
		<div style="text-align: justify;">
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div style="text-align: justify;">
			<span style="font-size:16px;">6. Fashion accessories - a simple outfit can be perfectly completed with one smaller accessory that will retain the focus. Be careful with big bracelets, earrings or necklaces. They&#39;re all often far from indispensable, especially if worn all at once.</span></div>
		<div style="text-align: justify;">
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div style="text-align: justify;">
			<span style="font-size:16px;">7. The truth is, however you feel about your body, you need to find clothing for your current body figure. Even if you plan on losing weight, you must have enough self confidence to feel the best you can in your own skin and clothes.</span></div>
		<div style="text-align: justify;">
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div style="text-align: justify;">
			<span style="font-size:16px;">Love your body, regardless of its shape and size.</span></div>
